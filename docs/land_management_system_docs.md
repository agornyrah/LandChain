# Complete Working Land Management System with Blockchain Integration

## Project Overview

Create a comprehensive land management system that integrates blockchain technology for secure, transparent, and immutable land record management. The system provides a complete solution for land registration, ownership tracking, transaction management, and dispute resolution.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: ReactJS with modern UI components and responsive design
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for RESTful API development
- **Database**: SQLite for local data storage and caching
- **Blockchain**: Hyperledger Fabric for immutable land records and smart contracts
- **Additional Tools**: Web3 integration, cryptographic libraries, and authentication systems

## Core Features and Web Application Structure

### 1. User Management & Authentication

- Multi-role authentication (Land Owners, Government Officials, Surveyors, Legal Advisors)
- Digital identity verification with blockchain-based certificates
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Two-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- User profile management with KYC integration

### 2. Land Registry & Property Management

- Digital land title creation and management
- Property boundary mapping with GPS coordinates
- Land parcel subdivision and merging capabilities
- Property valuation tracking and history
- Document management (deeds, surveys, certificates)
- Property search and discovery with advanced filters

### 3. Blockchain Integration Features

- Immutable land ownership records on Hyperledger Fabric
- Smart contracts for automated property transfers
- Blockchain-based property history and provenance tracking
